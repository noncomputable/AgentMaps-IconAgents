# AgentMaps-Spritegents

Spritegents is a plugin for [AgentMaps](https://github.com/noncomputable/AgentMaps) that lets you depict agents as custom icons instead of circles.

You can get a bundle [here]() or install it via npm (`npm install spritemaps`). 
You'll need to include Agentmaps and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/download.html) first.

Documentation and explanation is [here]().

A demo of Spritegents with the basic [AgentMaps epidemic simulation](https://noncomputable.github.io/AgentMaps/demos/epidemic/epidemic.html) is [here]().  
You can see its source [here]().
