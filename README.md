# AgentMaps-IconAgents

IconAgents is a plugin for [AgentMaps](https://github.com/noncomputable/AgentMaps) that lets you depict agents as custom icons instead of circles.

You can get a bundle [here](https://unpkg.com/agentmaps-iconagents@1/site/dist/iconagents.js) or install it via npm (`npm install agentmaps-iconagents`). 
You'll need to include AgentMaps and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/download.html) first.

Documentation and explanation is [here](https://noncomputable.github.io/AgentMaps-IconAgents/docs/).

A demo of AgentMaps-IconAgents with the basic [AgentMaps epidemic simulation](https://noncomputable.github.io/AgentMaps/demos/epidemic/epidemic.html) is [here](https://noncomputable.github.io/AgentMaps-IconAgents/demos/epidemic/epidemic.html).  
You can see its source [here](https://github.com/noncomputable/AgentMaps-IconAgents/tree/gh-pages/demos/epidemic).
